# Python Web Server (Flask) created using Docker and configured using Ansible

## 1. Python App

### 1.1 Introduction
This web application is a simple web application to manage a `mysql` db. It is coded in python using the `Flask` framework to develop a **Web Server Controller** to manage request, perform tasks and render templates to show on the exposed port (8080)

### 1.2 app.py

#### 1.2.1 Core Concepts
Main script to run the Flask web server. At first we have the following line:
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```
Because Every Flask application is an WSGI instance of the Flask class. Therefore, we need to create the instance called app (you can choose the name you want). It is needed to pass the reserved variable `__name__`, which will be `__main__` if it is the main module, the one executed by the interpreter, not by another python script.

At the end we have:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host=PYTHON_HOST, port=PYTHON_PORT)
```

Because when you run the file as a script by passing the file object to your Python interpreter `__name__` is `__main__`, therefore the expression expression `__name__` == `__main__` returns `True`, so the code block under will run. Otherwise it will be `False`, and nothing will be executed.

#### 1.2.2 Controller Configuration
**Basic Endpoint Configuration**

```python
@app.route("/")
def main():
    return "Welcome to the MySQL DB Tester!\n"
```

Flask makes us transparent the path exposure. So we just need to add decorators to out methods, like: `app.route("the_route_i_want")`

>:warning: **WARNING:** Al definir una URL acabada con el car치cter `/`, si el usuario accede a esa URL sin dicho car치cter, Flask lo redirigir치 a la URL acabada en `/`. En cambio, si la URL se define sin acabar en `/` y el usuario accede indicando la `/` al final, Flask dar치 un error HTTP 404.

**Render Template Endpoint**

## 2. Docker Compose
### 2.1 Building and configuring Mysql Service
We are going to use the base image of mysql [mysql:5.7](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql), so no Dockerfile is needed.

The configuration of the mysql is in [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) and in the [.env](.env) file:

| **Configuration** |  |
| :---: | :---: |
| **MYSQL_DATABASE** | db |
| **MYSQL_USER** | user |
| **MYSQL_PASSWORD** | password |
| **MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD** | password |

Pull the `mysql:5.7` image:
```bash
docker pull mysql:5.7
```

The database service will be running on container port: `3306`. And it will be binded to localhost:`3306`. But it is not actually needed to bind it, because the web server is going to consume it via the `docker network`

### 2.2 Building Web Server Service
The web server image configuration is in [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

Pull the `ubuntu:20.04` image:
```bash
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
```

Build the configured image with the needed to run the webserver using the custom Dockerfile:
```bash
docker build -t python-ws .
```

> :paperclip: **NOTE:** [.dockerignore](.dockerignore) file contains the directories / files to not to be included when copy or add in the docker image.

The web application service will be running on container port: `8080`. And it will be binded to localhost:`8080` port.

### 2.3 Running the services
User docker compose to run both services:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

When you want to stop the services
```bash
docker compose down
```
